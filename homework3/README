-changed the csv columns for easier . notation reference.(fixed it with index notation)
-also used USA.json, a topojson to generate my US maps and various imports
-used usa-state-capital.json to find coordinates of state capitals but didn't end up using it
-used hello.js to handle changing titles
-had some git conflicts, solved by manually deleting branchs in repo and local files.
